# hello-world
My first GitHub project.

Hi there, my name is Geoff Lawson, a computer programmer since earning my Computer Science degree in 1997.

I have programmed using Delphi (old skool), ASP.NET, C#, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript, Python Oracle PL/SQL and Microsoft T-SQL.  

I have also managed dev and test teams for many years.

This is my first foray in using Git....!
